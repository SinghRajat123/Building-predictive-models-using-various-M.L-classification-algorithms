We employ a varied collection of five separate machine learning models to perform predictive analyses on a historical dataset concerning rainfall, minimum, and maximum temperatures. These models are distinguished by their individual methodologies, each possessing unique strengths and capabilities.
We have Combine all the models built using the averaging technique to generate the final predictions.
