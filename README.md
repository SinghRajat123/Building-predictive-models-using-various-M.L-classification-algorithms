We employ a varied collection of five separate machine learning models to perform predictive analyses on a historical dataset concerning rainfall, minimum, and maximum temperatures. These models are distinguished by their individual methodologies, each possessing unique strengths and capabilities. Our strategy involves integrating various classification algorithms, thereby encompassing a comprehensive range of techniques to effectively tackle the complexities associated with this multifaceted task.
Combine all the models built using the averaging technique to generate the final predictions.
